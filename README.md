# Devy Study Part 2

Complete the following tasks.
  1. Say "Alexa, tell Devy to list my issues." to list your open issues on GitHub. Notice that the listed issues are for the correct repository.
  2. Say "Alexa, tell Devy I'm ready to start working on issue 2." to have Devy prepare your workspace for you by checking out a new branch.
  3. Say "Alexa, ask Devy what the current branch is." to get the name of the branch that was created.
  4. Resolve the issue: create the file CHANGELOG.md in the root of the devy-study-2 repository, open the file, and insert the text _# CHANGELOG_ on the first line.
  5. Say "Alexa, I'm done." to commit your work and open a pull request.

After creating the pull request, Devy will open it in a Google Chrome window for review. There are a few of things to notice. First, Devy changed the issue into an open pull request. Next, it assigned the reviewers elicited in the conversation. Finally, it automatically ran tests on your changed code and posted the results as a comment on the pull request with a detailed description of what tests were run and why, and the pass rate. This is an example of Devy operating like a bot.
